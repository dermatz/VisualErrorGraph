# Visual Error Graph

## Description

Visual Error Graph is a VS Code extension that provides an intuitive, graph-based visualization of error propagation in your code. It helps developers understand how errors cascade through their applications by displaying error relationships and call stacks in an interactive graph format.

The extension automatically analyzes your error handling patterns and creates visual representations that make it easier to track error flows, identify potential issues, and optimize error handling strategies.
